A small tool for a kakebo notebook

#### What is kakebo? 
You could find about in the wikipedia article (sure there is one), but is an accountable technic for home finances.
And this project aims to build a small web app for supporting this technic and, at the same time, give me the opportunity to learn reasonml/bucklescript/ocaml.
